# Support Request from the Gitaly Team

The goal of this template is to create a consistent experience for customer support requests from the Gitaly Team. Due to the size of the team and ambitious amount of work we try to complete, it helps us tremendously to have a common issue format for requests that can be prioritized appropriately. It also helps keep a record of issues experienced that can benefit other teams in the future.

As we collaborate on resolution of this issue, the Gitaly team will attempt to utilize this as a single source of truth.
